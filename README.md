### Introduction:
This is an example of the behavioral design pattern called "Observer" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
This example is based on the world level of the videogame Genshin Impact. 

In this case, the World is the object observed by other objects (like Enemies or Rewards),  which will react if the World change something.

More specifically, if the level of the world change, the level of the enemies and the quantity of the rewards will change too. The new values for the observers will be determinated by the level of the world and other internal paramenters that they have, like it rarity or rank.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Observer/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Observer/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
